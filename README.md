# hello-world

Hi fellas!

KJ here, greeting with so-much-I-can-offered kindness and beers. 
I really wanted to get to know git better since last time I heard its name, like 4 years ago. 
But much time was taken by fooling around and reading so that ever since I have completed nothing in terms of programming skills, or work skills. 
Hopefully I can do a little better than the old me. 

Listening to "The Deer", "Buckskin Stallion Blues" from "Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri".
